# Microsoft's Blockchain Workbench

Microsoft caught the interest of the blockchain community with their "Project Bletchley" quite a while ago. Now, at their annual 
developer conference at the beginning of May, they unveiled [Blockchain Workbench](http://aka.ms/abcworkbench). Its intent is to be a solution accelerator for 
blockchain PoCs, basically removing the obstacles of infrastructure setup and all the other red tape that is in the way of 
actually proofing out use cases for business owners.

In this talk Christoph is answering questions such as "Is it for you?", "How does it compare to Hyperledger Composer?", as well 
as "How does it work architecturally?". Because even if the Workbench per se isn't right for your needs, some of the architecture 
might well be - even on infrastructures other than Azure.

Christoph is MVP for Azure. He is an independent consultant, supporting companies in everything Azure, Windows and Web 
(he was ASP.NET MVP for ten+ years). Aside from working on his own projects, he is also involved in other OSS projects, such as the 
[.NET decompiler ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy). You can reach him via [https://twitter.com/WilleChristoph](https://twitter.com/WilleChristoph).
