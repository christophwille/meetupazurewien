# Big Data Analytics with Azure HDInsight

When looking at Google Cloud, AWS or Azure you will find a wide array of PaaS big data services - from storage to processing. 
However, what if you want to stick with tried-and-true Hadoop (and there are very good reasons for that)? Well, you could roll 
your own Hadoop cluster in the cloud of your choice using IaaS - or you could turn to [HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/) 
which offers you a fully managed Hadoop experience based on the Hortonworks distribution. Spark, Storm, Kafka - you name it, you got it.
