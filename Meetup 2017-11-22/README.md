# Azure Functions Workshop

What was (is) known as Azure App Service WebJobs morphed into full-fledged serverless Azure Functions. 
These are constantly evolving, and the integrations keep on coming: event processing with Azure Event Grid 
and/or Stream Analytics, database triggers for Azure Cosmos DB, cross-platform developer experience 
and of course Linux and containers are in the mix too. Did I mention that you can 
bring any programming language?

What we'll do - followed by a show-and-tell presentation about the latest and greatest features of Azure Functions, 
we'll dive into a coding session (a basic understanding of Azure Functions is assumed, you might want to at least watch
[A day in the life of an Azure serverless developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdiKoWdrIn4). This means: bring 
your Macs and PCs (curiosity too)! If you don't happen to have an Azure subscription, please go to
